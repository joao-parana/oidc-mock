# OIDC (OpenID Connect) Test Server

This is a OIDC Test Server for development purposes. It's based on **oidc-provider** NPM package whith type definitions via DefinitelyTyped. Using TypeScript with oidc-provider allows you to leverage **static typing**, which improves error detection during development, refactoring, and code maintainability. oidc-provider's well-defined interfaces and types integrate seamlessly with TypeScript language. In addition we have Improved Developer Experience in IDEs with autocompletion, type checking, and inline documentation. TypeScript makes development with oidc-provider more efficient and less error-prone.

## oidc-provider: A Complete OIDC Server for Node.js

**oidc-provider** is a robust and highly configurable NPM library that allows you to implement a **complete OpenID Connect (OIDC) server** in Node.js. It's an excellent choice for anyone needing a flexible and standardized Identity Provider (IdP), especially in **TypeScript environments**.

### Key Features

oidc-provider offers a wide range of features to meet OIDC and OAuth 2.0 specifications:

- **Complete OIDC/OAuth 2.0 Implementation:** Supports all authentication and authorization flows defined in the specifications, including:
  - **Authorization Code Flow:** The most common and secure flow.
  - **Implicit Flow:** Primarily used for older SPAs (Single Page Applications).
  - **Hybrid Flow:** Combines elements of the code and implicit flows.
  - **Client Credentials Flow:** For machine-to-machine authentication.
  - **Device Authorization Flow:** For devices with limited input.
- **Client Management:** Allows you to register and manage OIDC clients (applications that will use your OIDC server for authentication). This includes support for **Dynamic Client Registration**, where clients can register themselves automatically.
- **Extension and Discovery Support:** Implements **OpenID Connect Discovery 1.0**, allowing clients to automatically discover your provider's endpoints and capabilities. It also supports various OAuth 2.0 and OIDC extensions, such as:
  - **PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange):** Enhances the security of the Authorization Code Flow for public clients.
  - **Client Initiated Backchannel Authentication (CIBA):** For authentication without browser redirection.
  - **Grant Management:** User consent management.
  - **RAR (Rich Authorization Requests):** For more complex authorization requests.
- **Extensive Customization:** Virtually all aspects of the provider can be customized through configurations and hooks, including:
  - **Storage Adapter:** You decide where data (users, sessions, tokens) will be stored. This can be a relational database (PostgreSQL, MySQL) or NoSQL (MongoDB, Redis).
  - **Views and UI:** The user interface for login and consent is completely customizable.
  - **Request Validation and Manipulation:** Hooks to intercept and modify default behavior.
- **Tokens:** Generation and validation of:
  - **ID Tokens:** Contain information about the authenticated user.
  - **Access Tokens:** For accessing protected resources.
  - **Refresh Tokens:** For obtaining new Access Tokens without requiring the user to log in again.
- **Logout:** Supports Single Sign-Out (SSO) to end sessions across multiple applications.

### Advantages of Using oidc-provider with TypeScript and Node.js

Using oidc-provider to build an OIDC server in TypeScript and running it on Node.js offers several significant advantages:

- **Standard Compliance:** The main advantage is the **guarantee of compliance** with the strict OpenID Connect and OAuth 2.0 specifications. Building an OIDC server from scratch is extremely complex and prone to security and interoperability errors. oidc-provider handles all the complexity of the standards for you.
- **Built-in Security:** As a mature and widely used implementation, it already incorporates **best security practices** for authentication and authorization flows, protecting against common vulnerabilities.
- **Flexibility and Extensibility:** The oidc-provider architecture was designed to be **highly extensible**. The ability to customize storage, user interface, and flows through adapters and hooks makes it suitable for almost any use case, without needing to modify the library's source code.
- **Accelerated Development:** Instead of spending months implementing OIDC details, you can focus on your application's **business logic**. oidc-provider provides the solid foundation, allowing you to quickly set up a functional IdP.
- **Active Community and Maintenance:** As an active project on NPM and GitHub, it benefits from an **active community**, regular updates, and continuous maintenance, ensuring it stays up-to-date with the latest specifications and security patches.
- **TypeScript Benefits:**
  - **Strong Typing:** Using TypeScript with oidc-provider allows you to leverage **static typing**, which improves error detection during development, refactoring, and code maintainability. oidc-provider's well-defined interfaces and types integrate seamlessly with TypeScript.
  - **Improved Developer Experience:** With autocompletion, type checking, and inline documentation, TypeScript makes development with oidc-provider more efficient and less error-prone.
- **Node.js Ecosystem:** Running on Node.js means you can take advantage of the vast NPM package ecosystem, Node.js's asynchronous performance, and the familiarity of the JavaScript language (or TypeScript transpiled to JS).

In summary, oidc-provider is the good solution for anyone looking to build a secure, and customizable OpenID Connect server using Node.js and TypeScript, saving time and ensuring compliance with industry standards.
